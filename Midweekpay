The eight states that allow payday loans and have banks that charge as much as or more than state-licensed payday lenders are Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington. For example, in Virginia, a car title lender—which is similar to a payday lender but secures loans with car titles—makes loans that it contends do not have to comply with Virginia law because they are originated by a Utah-based bank. This lender issued a three-year, $2,272 loan with an annual percentage rate (APR) of 98.7%, and $4,867 in finance charges. This means the borrower would repay $7,139 on a $2,272 loan. For a customer with a comparable credit history, the cost from a state-licensed nonbank lender for the same loan in Virginia is about $1,611, three times less than the bank charges via its title loan partner.
